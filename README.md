# ImprovedYolo
Improved YOLO-Based object detection with multiple Fine Tunings

This is our repository for one of our student's final undergraduate project in UPF. This project specifically focusses on improving the baseline Yolo object detection mechanisms on detecting the car in pedestarial complex. The model was trained on the Kitti dataset. 

This project based on this work : https://github.com/huseinzol05/YOLO-Object-Detection-Tensorflow using kitti dataset : http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_object.php?obj_benchmark.
