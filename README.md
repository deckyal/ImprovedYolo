# ImprovedYolo
[Student Project] Improved YOLO-Based object detection with multiple Fine Tunings

This is our repository for one of our student's final undergraduate project in UPF. This project specifically focusses in improving baseline Yolo object detection mechanisms to detect cars in pedestarial complex. The model was trained on the Kitti dataset. 

This project based on this work : https://github.com/huseinzol05/YOLO-Object-Detection-Tensorflow using kitti dataset : http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_object.php?obj_benchmark. 

Download the models here : https://drive.google.com/open?id=1eLwyVvhpsG6E7KROdATsnDHNNmXjDsTx and put in the main folder.
